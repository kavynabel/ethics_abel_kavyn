## My Ethical Principles

_Think of this like your data science ten commandments with respect to ethically using data and data science tools._

In working with data for someone else I will make sure to find the truth from the data, and not just show the client what they want to see.

I will think deeply about where my data is coming from before diving right in.

I will ask questions and seek to know the meaning behind the data to help me more accurately use it.

I will seek to know the implications of the data. How people I present to will receive it and present my findings in an understandable manner.

I will not hide or disguise certain findings with misleading charts.

## Reading Discussion

_Provide a short summary of the primary principle of each reading we completed in class. This summary should be in your style and what you gleaned._

From job seeking advice to my younger self article I learned that networking is more essential than mindlessly applying to jobs. Don't get me wrong, I'm a fan of applying to lots of jobs in a greater odds of getting one. But I think a smarter way may be to always expand your network. If interested in a certain company, try to connect and talk with people from the company. Listen for what may help you when applying to a job, learn what project they are working on, what skills you need, who the hiring manager is, ask to connect with them etc... This way you can better find out if you want to work there, possibly connect with the one who is actually doing the hiring, and if not, have a much more tailored cover letter and resume.

In How to spot red flags in a data science job opportunity article I learned to ask about a recent project and why it was built. If they say that boss man so and so told them, that is not a good sign. If they can explain the process and why it was needed, and why they did what they did, that is a great sign that the communication of why things need to get done are being passed down the chain.

Big data and their epistemological challenge discusses the obscurity of "big data". "Big data" does not only mean large sets of data and using tools that can handle these large datasets, but about the impact that our analyses from these large datasets can have. I need to think more about the implications of what I say with my findings from data.

From an ethical code can't be about ethics I learned that a data scientist should help automate processes that can be automated and give more time the the decision makers to worry about making those decisions.

In reading Ethical codes vs ethical code I got out of it that as a data scientist I need to find the unbiased truth, and not tailor it to my client or boss for their convincing purposes.

The future history of data engineering article helped me to know that data people used to be hired more for setting up the initial infrastructure, and now we are more used to help make informed business decisions. The problem nowadays isn't getting the data, its using the data.

From Data scientists: Generalist or Specialist I understand that the ideal data scientist is a strong generalist who brings uniques specialties to the teacm that complement the rest of the group.

In this article: Physiognomy's new clothes, it discussed a study that was done using facial recognition to identify the "criminal type" and it discussed ideas such as where the photos were coming from. Were they already biased. Was the model picking up on the slight frown of criminals that they had as opposed to slightly upturned lips with images of successful individuals. Are we introducing already existing biases into models that we make even in accidentally. There are a lot of things to consider when making a model and we need to be as careful as we can to avoid bias and be able to explain what our model does, if we are to interpret and use the results of the model.

In Building a data science practice from scratch article I learned that when starting up, it is most important to create a solid data foundation before getting to the quote on quote "cool" stuff. Don't make things fancy, but just make sure that the things you need and work with, actually work. Later on you can make things more fancy.

Leaving academia to start a data science company: Looking back at our first year was a very interesting article to read. One thing that was said that really resonated with me was that in his consulting work he was always learning something new, but for the purpose of work. So it became draining, and not as fun as learning these things in data science used to be. He learned that he still needed to set aside some time to relax and just learn some things for himself, for fun, and that kept the fire going as he continued in data science. I feel that this will be true for me as well.

From our insurance reading titled, Minority Neighborhoods Pay Higher Car Insurance Premiums Than White Areas With the Same Risk brought out the problem that minority neighborhoods were paying higher for car insurance than non-minority neighborhoods with the same average risk. This article actualy made me think about terms that they were using such as average risk, "safe" driver, and "risky" white zip codes. I would like to see how they are justifying what goes into these categories. I think it is important to be totally transparent when sharing findings from data.

In the article At Airbnb, data science belongs everywhere I like that they explained that data isn't numbers, it's people. I think that is really important to remember as a data scientist. Don't get caught up in the numbers, the data, the statistics, but remember that this data represents people. And based on the data set, maybe its how they feel about a product, how they act, what they like. Remembering that data is people will help me as a data scientist to interpret it, use it, and present it more apporporiately and in the context of the people that the data represents.

In Building a data team at a mid-stage startup: a short story article it was a story in the perspective of a new data science manager being hired and learning about al the problems in managing data between the different teams. One thing that I learned is that it is important to have good relationships with all the departments that are interacting with the data. Maybe that's the marketing team or the engineering team. Understand what they know and how they interact with the data. Set up a good infrastructure for everyone to use before just doing the flashy stuff like machine learning. This helps me know that wherever I go I should ensure that there is a solid foundation and pipeline for the data if I am in a position that an influence that.
